I'd like to learn the knowledge of modern operating system as much as possible, including different type of OS like window and linux, and know the differences and similarities between each other. Also, want to learn the basic knowledge of how to build a OS based on C.
The experience of learning Vagrant, Vim and Git is pretty good. The TA demo covered everything we needed for starting the project.
